Hello! MY name is Rushali Khilrani.
I live in Delhi.
I am an ungdergrad student at IGDTUW.
I am currently heading the Eco club of IGDTUW and working on a pan India project that aims at changing the way we consume food.
Here's a link to one of my projects: https://github.com/rushalikhilrani/sudoku-solver   
It is a sudoku solving game in c++ that challenges the participant based on the difficulty level he chooses.
